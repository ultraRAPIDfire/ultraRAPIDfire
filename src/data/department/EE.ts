These early subjects align with the OBE mandate for structured progression, ensuring that learners acquire the core reasoning, communication skills, and ethical awareness necessary for subsequent technical learning.  \tGeneral education courses complement these technical foundations by strengthening students' communication, critical‑thinking, and societal awareness—competencies later applied in laboratory work, design activities, and collaborative problem‑solving tasks. The College’s sustained curricular development philosophy ensures that these foundational courses support not only academic progression but also student readiness for higher‑level engineering thinking."

The OBE framework requires that teaching strategies and assessments in these courses directly map to student outcomes (problem‑solving, experimentation, communication, design under constraints, etc.) and are monitored for CQI."

These activities serve as capstone‑style demonstrations of students’ readiness for practice within the competencies defined by the OBE framework. \t \tThe program incorporates industry‑aligned applications, encouraging students to engage with challenges relevant to local power, industrial, and community contexts. Such alignment reflects the College’s commitment to program relevance and responsiveness, supported by ongoing curricular enhancement efforts.
