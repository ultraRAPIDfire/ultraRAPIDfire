            "Bulacan State University, through its Gender and Development Center, held the 2026 National Women’s Month Convocation at the Bulacan Capitol Gymnasium, bringing together university leaders, local officials, and students to celebrate the vital contributions of women and promote gender equality. The event featured inspiring messages from academic and government leaders, culminating in a keynote address by Senator Risa Hontiveros, who encouraged the community to 'Lead Like a Babaylan'—a call for everyday leadership rooted in courage, service, and advocacy. The program reinforced BulSU’s commitment to inclusivity, dignity, and empowering every individual to become an agent of positive change in society.",
